                My name is Mohammed Ali, and I am a freelance web developer living in Rawalpindi,
                Pakistan. I completed my B.A. in Computer Science this year (results pending).
                I possess various soft skills that can contribute to business growth, such as
                problem-solving, management, data analysis, research, and team leadership.
                Although I don't have professional experience in a software house, I am a
                self-learner and have built several projects. <a href="/projects" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-900  "> /Check my projects/</a>
